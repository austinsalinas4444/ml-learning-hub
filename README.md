# ml-learning-hub

A personal repository to store my machine learning notes, code snippets, and reference notebooks.

This is where I collect, organize, and revisit everything I'm learning — from foundational NumPy operations to full modeling pipelines. It's meant to grow over time as I build real-world projects, revisit tricky concepts, and explore new tools (like FastAI, PyTorch, and beyond).

## 🧰 What’s in Here

- Jupyter notebooks with hands-on walkthroughs
- Python `.py` files for reusable functions/utilities
- Markdown notes for key concepts or “aha” moments
- Snapshots of course materials I don’t want to forget (e.g., Coursera, FastAI)

## 🚧 Still Learning

This repo is a work in progress — not everything is polished. But it's mine, and it helps me think better, code better, and build better.
